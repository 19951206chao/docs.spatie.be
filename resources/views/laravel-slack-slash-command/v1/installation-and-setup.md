## Setting up a Slash command at Slack.com

coming soon

## Installing the package

The package can be installed in your Laravel app via composer:

``` bash
composer require spatie/laravel-slash-slack-command
```

Next, you must install the service provider:

```php
// config/app.php
'providers' => [
    ...
    Spatie\SlashCommand\SlashCommandServiceProvider::class,
];
```

You can publish the config file with this command:
```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Spatie\SlashCommand\SlashCommandServiceProvider" --tag="config"
```

This is the contents of the published config file:

```php
return [

    /**
     * Over at Slack you can configure to which url the slack commands must be send.  
     * url here. You must specify that. Be sure to leave of the domain name.
     */
    'url' => 'slack',

    /**
     * The token generated by Slack with which to verify if a incoming slash command request is valid.
     */
    'token' => env('SLACK_SLASH_COMMAND_VERIFICATION_TOKEN'),

    /**
     * The handlers that will process the slash command. We'll call handlers from top to bottom
     * until the first one whose `canHandle` method returns true.
     */
    'handlers' => [
        //add your own handlers here
        
        
        //this handler will respond with a `Could not handle command` message.
        Spatie\SlashCommand\Handlers\CatchAll::class,
    ],
];
```
