The Medialibrary package requires **PHP 7.0+** and **Laravel 5.1.0+**. To create derived images **[GD](http://php.net/manual/en/book.image.php)** needs to be installed on your server. If you want to create PDF thumbnails **[Imagick](http://php.net/manual/en/imagick.setresolution.php)** is also required.

If you're stuck on PHP 5 take a look at [V3 of this package](https://docs.spatie.be/laravel-medialibrary/v3/introduction).
