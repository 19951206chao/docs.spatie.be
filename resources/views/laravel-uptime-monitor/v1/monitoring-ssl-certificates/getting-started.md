This package can monitor ssl certificates. It can send you when an invalid certificate is found. Additionally it can warn you a couple of days before a certificate expires.

To get started you should have to [create a monitor](https://docs.spatie.be/laravel-uptime-monitor/v1/monitoring-uptime/getting-started#creating-your-first-monitor). If the url stars with `https://` the package will automatically enable a certification check.
